### CTF Name: include-this
### Platform: CyberEDU

### Description:
Try harder!

### Solution:
After visiting the webpage, we encounter a button that redirects us to a specific URL (ip:port/file=test.txt) and displays the content of the file upon clicking. This behavior suggests a potential vulnerability such as Local File Inclusion (LFI).
Testing the "file" parameter for LFI, we attempted to modify the parameter value to "flag.txt," which resulted in an error message. The error indicates that the current directory is /var/www/html/test.
By modifying the parameter value to traverse 4 directories back and access "flag.txt," we successfully retrieved the flag.
